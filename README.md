# Crane

An iOS app for climbing training using any compatible scale. At the moment, targeting the WHC06 and the Tindeq Progressor.

The project started with using the Weiheng WHC06, however it is not as accurate or as fast as the Tindeq Progressor. The scale publishes data using Bluetooth advertisement data rather than establishing a Bluetooth connection. The speed at which an iOS device reads the advertisement data isn't particularly fast, so the data does not come in at a high frequency. There's a chance this would be better on an Android app.
