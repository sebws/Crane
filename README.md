# Crane

An iOS app for climbing training using the WH-C06 scale from WeiHeng Manufacturer.

It is not as accurate or as fast as the Tindeq Progressor. The scale publishes data using Bluetooth advertisement data rather than establishing a Bluetooth connection. The speed at which an iOS device reads the advertisement data isn't particularly fast, so the data does not come in at a super high frequency. There's a chance this would be better on an Android app.
